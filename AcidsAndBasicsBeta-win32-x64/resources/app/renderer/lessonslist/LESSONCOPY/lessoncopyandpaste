        <p class="paragraph">
            Here is my opening sentence. Before i get into what REALLY matters,  im going to do a big break between this and the next paragraph.
            <br>
            <br>
            See, wasn't that really cool? In fact, I might italicize my opinion by <em>using the em tags!</em> And if my writing is getting too long,
            I'm free to go to the next line without actually breaking the text by simply going to the next line! Note that this does NOT mean a next line
            on the page. It will keep going until it hits the border, or you use "< br >"!

            <br>
            <br>
            Now i'm going to insert an image after a space.
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/lesson8/bohrmodelatom.webp" width=30% height=30% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <br>
            <br>
            Wasn't that so cool? I even centered it with the "style" part, and it takes up 30% of the screen for width and height, no matter the window size!
            <br>
            Sometimes though, you don't know what a word is. Such as the word <span id="monkey"><b>monkey</b></span>. Click on that and you'll find out!
        </p>

        <!--Running Custom Alert scripts here.-->
        <!--Also doing the "lessonclicked" json change-->
        <script>
            saveLessonClicked("WHATEVER LESSON YOU ARE WRITING AT THE MOMENT!!!!!!!!!!!"); //eg. "lesson7", "lesson8", always "lesson+lessonnumber"

            //This is me making the words i chose actually clickable!
            document.getElementById("monkey").addEventListener("click", () => {
                customAlert("I monkey, you monkey, everyone monkey.");
            });

            
        </script>
