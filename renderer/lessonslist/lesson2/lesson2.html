                Since we now know that everything tangible is made of matter, and all matter is made of particles, we can now take a look at what affects those
                particles. One of the most important factors that impacts particles is <span id="temperature"><b>temperature</b></span>. When temperature
                rises, particles of matter experience more <span id="kineticenergy"><b>kinetic energy</b></span>, which means they bounce and move around a lot
                more! With temperature change, matter can differ in <span id=volatility><b>volatility</b></span> and in state of matter.
