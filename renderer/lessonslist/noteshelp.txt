- Make sure you redeclare any fonts you're planning to use in the lessonstyles.css one, and make sure you are ONLY using this css file. Thanks.




CSS Help:

    Absolute Units (fixed physical size — not responsive)

        px (pixels) → 1 dot on the screen. Doesn’t change with zoom or screen size (but looks smaller on higher-resolution displays).

        in (inches) → 1 inch in the physical world. Rarely used in web design.

        cm / mm (centimeters / millimeters) → Physical measurement units. Rarely used because screens don’t have consistent real-world sizes.

        pt (points) → 1/72 of an inch. More common in print styles.

    Relative to Viewport (responsive to screen size)

        vw (viewport width) → 1% of the width of the browser’s viewport.
        Example: 10vw = 10% of the viewport’s width.

        vh (viewport height) → 1% of the height of the browser’s viewport.
        Example: 50vh = half the height of the viewport.

        vmin → 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height).

        vmax → 1% of the larger dimension.

    Relative to Font Size

        em → Relative to the font size of the element (or inherited from its parent).
        Example: If the font size is 16px, 2em = 32px.

        rem (root em) → Relative to the font size of the <html> element (root).
        More consistent than em because it ignores nested scaling.

        ex → Relative to the height of the lowercase x in the font. Rarely used.

        ch → Width of the 0 (zero) character in the font. Useful for monospace layouts.

        Relative to Container

        % → Relative to the parent container’s size (width or height depending on context).

    💡 Rule of thumb:

        Use px for small fixed things (like borders, shadows).

        Use em or rem for font sizes so they scale with accessibility settings.

        Use vw / vh for layouts that adapt to the screen size.

        Use % when sizing elements relative to their container.
