        <p class="paragraph">
            In our world, everything that takes up space and has weight <span id="massvolume"><b>(mass/volume)</b></span> is considered to be <i>matter.</i><br>
            A box of cards is matter, a cup of water is matter, and YOU are even made of matter. However, matter does not appear in the same form for every case.<br>
            <br>
            There are three main <span id="states"><b>states of matter</b></span>: liquid, solid, and gas. 


            <br>

            <i> Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT): </i><br>
            The KMT is a scientific model that explains the behavior of gases by focusing on how their particles move.
            It says that gas particles are incredibly small compared to the space between them, they move in constant random motion, 
            and they collide with each other and with container walls without losing energy. According to the KMT, there are 
            no forces pulling gas particles together — they only interact when they collide. This theory helps scientists understand and 
            predict how gases respond to changes in pressure, temperature, and volume, which is the foundation for gas laws you'll learn later.
