          <br> <span id="matter"><b>Matter</b></span> as we know today exists in three phases - <span id="solid"><b>solid</b></span>, <span id="liquid"><b>liquid</b></span>, and <span id="gas"><b>gas</b></span>. This is specifically distinguished by the behavior of fundamental particles.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            However, there exists a fourth state of matter known as <b><span id="plasma"></span></b>, which is a very good conductor of electricity & respnonds to magnetics fields,

            behaving differently from a gas

          The mentioned composition and movement contributes to the following properties of each individual phase
