               <br> In science, it is especially important to understand the difference between <span id="physical change"><b>physical change</b></span> 
               & <span id=" chemical changes"><b>chemical changes</b></span> as they can explain the many ways through which matter can transform.
               Furthermore, by learning to recognize such changes, natural processes can be better explained and connected to real-life application.

             <h1 class="cool-header-blue"><strong>How to distinguish between physical & chemical changes</strong> </h1>

            <p> 
                <br> Properly distinguishing between physical and chemical changes can be challenging at times 
                since some changes don't show simiar signs, whilst others have  a complec nature.

                Such examples include

                <ul>
                <li> The dissolving of salt in water</li>
                <li> The formation of alloys</li>
                </ul>

      
           <br> Despite such challenges, there are many techniques that can be used to differentiate between the two.
             The following are some of the ways through which a physical chnage can be identified 

              <ul>
               <li> Reversible in many cases</li>
               <li> No new substance is formed</li>
               <li> Only physical properties (shape, size, volume , and changes in phase)</li>

              </ul>

            While on the other hand, some of the ways through which chemical changes are identified 

            <ul>
               <li> Change in color</li>
               <li> The production of gas bubbles</li>
               <li> The release or absorption of heat</li>

              </ul>
