                <br> Acids <span id="acids"></span> & Bases <span id ="bases" ></span>are two broad categories of chemical substanstnces
                that are described as "chemical states " due to many of the following reasons

                <ul>
                <li> Chemical definition</li>
                <li> Taste </li>

        <h1 class="cool-header-blue"><strong> Acids & Bases - Household items</strong>/h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
           <br> Many everyday household products contain acids and bases, even if we don’t always notice them. Many common items 

            are acidic because they contain acetic acid (CH3COOH) and citric acid (C6H8O7), which tends to  give them their sour taste.
            
           <br> Such items include

           <ul>
           <li> Vinegar </li>
           <li> Lime Juice</li>
           <li> Certain dairy products - Cheese</li>
           </ul>

           <br> While on the other hand, bases which often tends to be slippery, is commonly 
           used commonly in cleaning products.

           <ul>
           <li> Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) </li>
           <li> Ammonia (NH3)</li>
           <li> Soap & Toothpastes</li>
           </ul>

        <div id="Determining whether a substance is acidic / basic"> </div>
            <h1 class="cool-header-blue">" 
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br> Since many common acids & bases are commonly clearless liquids, it would
          be difficult to differentiate between acids & bases. Therefore, the following methods
          are used by scientists.

          <ul>
            <li> Indicators - A substance which undergoes observerable, chemical changes when being added
                to an acid / base. The resulting color is what determines whether a particular chemical is 
                acidic / basic.<br> Ex. When bromothyl-blue is added to an acid, solution becomes yellow, while becomes
                blue in basic solutions. 
            </li>

            <li> Litmus Paper - A type of paper that changes color when being submerged in a particular 
                solution. Ex. When litmus turns red : Acid / When litmus turns blue : Base /  If 
                litmus does not change color at all : Neutral

            </li>

        
          </ul>


       <div id="Rows vs Periods"> </div>
            <h3 class="cool-header-blue">"Periods keep the shell count still, families add shells at will."</h3> 
           <ul>
            <li> Period - When moving across the same period, no. of electron shells remains the same</li>
            <li> Family - However, when moving down the same family, the no. of electron shells increase</li>
           </ul>
 "

        <div id="The arrangement of periodic table">

        <p class="paragraph">
            Furthermore, this arrangement is beneficial in predicting both the physical and chemical properties of elements<br>
            For example,

            <div id="Physical properties"></div>
                <h3 class=" cool-header-blue">"Some of the predicted physical properties include the following"</h3>
 "              <ul>
                <li>Atomic Radius- The distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron orbital</li>
                <li>Metallic character- Metals, Non-metals, or metalloids</li>
                <li>Molar mass- The mass of one mole (SI unit of measurement) of an element  </li>
                <li>State of matter- Solid, Liquid, or Gaseous state</li>

                </ul>

            <div id="Chemical  properties"></div>
                <h3 class=" cool-header-blue">"Some of the predicted physical properties include"</h3>
 "              <ul>
                <li>Reactivity - A substance's tendency to undergo a chemical reaction </li>
                <li>Ionization energy - The energy required to remove one mole of an electron from one mole of a gaseous atom </li>
                <li>Electronegativity - The ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond<br> Pauling Scale can be used to quantify the electronegativity of an element</li>
                <li> Valence electrons - The electrons located in outermost orbital of an atom</li>

                </ul>
