                <br> Acids <span id="acids"></span> & Bases <span id ="bases" ></span>are two broad categories of chemical substanstnces
                that are described as "chemical states " due to many of the following reasons

                <ul>
                <li> Chemical definition</li>
                <li> Taste </li>

        <h1 class="cool-header-blue"><strong> Acids & Bases - Household items</strong>/h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
           <br> Many everyday household products contain acids and bases, even if we don’t always notice them. Many common items 

            are acidic because they contain acetic acid (CH3COOH) and citric acid (C6H8O7), which tends to  give them their sour taste.
            
           <br> Such items include

           <ul>
           <li> Vinegar </li>
           <li> Lime Juice</li>
           <li> Certain dairy products - Cheese</li>
           </ul>

           <br> While on the other hand, bases which often tends to be slippery, is commonly 
           used commonly in cleaning products.

           <ul>
           <li> Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) </li>
           <li> Ammonia (NH3)</li>
           <li> Soap & Toothpastes</li>
           </ul>


        </p>

        
        <div id="Determining whether a substance is acidic / basic"> </div>
            <h1 class="cool-header-blue">" 
        <p class="paragraph">
          <br> Since many common acids & bases are commonly clearless liquids, it would
          be difficult to differentiate between acids & bases. Therefore, the following methods
          are used by scientists.

          <ul>
            <li> Indicators - A substance which undergoes observerable, chemical changes when being added
                to an acid / base. The resulting color is what determines whether a particular chemical is 
                acidic / basic.<br> Ex. When bromothyl-blue is added to an acid, solution becomes yellow, while becomes
                blue in basic solutions. 
            </li>

            <li> Litmus Paper - A type of paper that changes color when being submerged in a particular 
                solution. Ex. When litmus turns red : Acid / When litmus turns blue : Base /  If 
                litmus does not change color at all : Neutral

            </li>

        
          </ul>

          <p> <br> The above methods can also be used to describe the pH of the salt that is formed as well. </p>
