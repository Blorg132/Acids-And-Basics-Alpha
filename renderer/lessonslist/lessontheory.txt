Lesson System Theory:




    After mainpage.html takes user to LESSONS.html as the **MAIN PAGE**, user clicks individual buttons
    that route to individual lessons. These lessons are therefore stored in the "lessonslist" folder.


    All lessons will/can use the "lessons.js" file which holds some universal functions, such as customAlert()
    which is needed for highlightable words. Universal CSS properties will also be put into the lessonstyles.css


    Each lesson will consist of three parts: the information, the test, and an unlocking system for the 
    practice section. This is gay, so we're going to have to add that into practice as well.
        - Create a global variable? Maybe a file with a bunch of variables?
        - What else can we unlock? Perhaps a store system?
        - Working on finishing the lesson first. Made lessoncomplete.html as reward screen.
        - This is kind of fucked. I don't really want to do this right now. Find a way to actually modify the file
        when the lesson completes.
        - This is what i'm doing first. Will push when it's done.
