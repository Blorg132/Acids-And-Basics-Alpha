        <p class="paragraph">
            Chemical reactions and equations are much more simple to understand than they appear, although they can explore much more difficults subjects, <em>learning how to balance equations</em> and the types of basic reactions is crucial to chemistry.
            <br>
            <br>
            Starting with the different types of reactions, to understand each reaction more clearly, press on the highlighted word to see a small diagram example.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main 5 reaction types are <span id="Synthesis"><b>Synthesis</b></span>, <span id="Decomposition"><b>Decomposition</b></span>, <span id="Single Replacement"><b>Single Replacement</b></span>, <span id="Double Replacement"><b>Double Replacement</b></span>, and <span id="Combustion"><b>Combustion</b></span> which is slightly different from the rest.
            <br>
            <br>
            To break it into simpler terms we use letters (A, B, C, D) to reference different elements, these let us simplify how compounds (two or more elements) are formed, pulled apart, or manipulated through the different chemical reactions. These reactions however do not destroy or remove an element from the equation, and a simple rule of thumb is that whatever elements you start out with, needs to be the same number you end with.
            <br>
            <br>
            Combustion was stated as being "unique" from the other main reaction types as it is not interchangable with majority of elements. For this case specfifically, usually a Hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen gas and produces water and CO₂ gas, which falls into the slightly more complicated forms of reactions.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is where balancing equations comes in, when a reaction occurs, its important to balance the amount of elements using coefficients in the equation, take for example the following:
            <br>
            <br>
            _A + _B₂ -> _A₂B₄
            <br>
            <br>
            Can you think of possible coefficients that would balance this equation? Here is the <span id="answer"><b>answer</b></span>. The coefficient is the number placed before the element, which multiplies the amount of elements that are paired to it. Now that you have understood the material, try the exam material.
