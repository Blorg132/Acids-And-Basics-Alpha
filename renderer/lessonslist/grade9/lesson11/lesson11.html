        <p class="paragraph">
            Chemical reactions and equations are much more simple to understand than they appear, although they can explore much more difficults subjects, <em>learning how to balance equations</em> and the types of basic reactions is crucial to chemistry.
            <br>
            <br>
            Starting with the different types of reactions, to understand each reaction more clearly, press on the highlighted words the main 5 reaction types are <span id="Synthesis"><b>Synthesis</b></span>
            Matter is made up of a bunch of particles bouncing around. But how many particles bounce around, and how fast they bounce around, is dependent
            on the actual state of matter. Solids, such as ice and wood, have the slowest moving particles. They generally don't move past each other
            and stay in a rigid structure, keeping their form no matter where they are. 
            Liquids are in the middle of the spectrum. They have faster moving particles that are actually able to move and flow past each other. This
            is one of the reasons that liquids "flow" in a container and fill up volume.
            Gases are at the very fast end of the spectrum. Their particles are zipping around, and there's hardly any proper form/connection between these
            particles aside from them all being part of the same piece of matter. Take a look at the image below to understand the differences between these three.

            Now i'm going to insert an image after a space.
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/lesson8/bohrmodelatom.webp" width=30% height=30% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <br>
            <br>
            Wasn't that so cool? I even centered it with the "style" part, and it takes up 30% of the screen for width and height, no matter the window size!
            <br>
            Sometimes though, you don't know what a word is. Such as the word <span id="monkey"><b>monkey</b></span>. Click on that and you'll find out!
