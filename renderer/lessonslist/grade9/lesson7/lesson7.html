        <p class="paragraph">
            The periodic table, first created in its modern state sometime in 1869 by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, gave scientists and chemists alike
            the opportunity to find relations and properties of elements based on where they were placed. The concept is simple, every element is organized
            into a <span id="period"><b>period</b></span> and a <span id="row"><b>row</b></span> that corresponds to certain properties. The best thing about it is,
            most elements next to each other (nearby, same row or period) tend to share some similarities as well! Let's take a look:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/periodictable.png" width=100% height=50%>
            <br>
            <br>
            It's a lot to look at, but let's just start from the left side. The first row, also known as Group 1, consists of your <span id="alkalimetals"><b>alkali metals</b></span>.
            Aside from hydrogen, which acts a bit different then the rest of the row, all of these elements act and react in a very similar fashion, aside from some
            differences in intensity and other physical characteristics. They'll bond similarily as well! (we'll go over that soon)
            <br>
            <br>
            The next row over is the <span id="alkalinemetals"><b>alkaline earth metal</b></span> group. Since the alkali metals are right next to Group 2, they share some similarities between them! First of all,
            they're both metals, which means they're generally shiny and like to conduct electricity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Next important group is the <span id="halogens"><b>halogens</b></span>. The halogens going down Group 17 are non-metals that are highly reactive, and usually want to gain an electron
            through a bond. You'll most likely see this in common compounds such as NaCl, or KBr. An important thing to note is that F, Cl, Br, and I are all <span id="diatomic"><b>diatomic</b></span> molecules,
            meaning that they're usually found bonded with each other! While one carbon atom is usually just C, flourine likes to stick in pairs, and so naturally occuring flourine looks like F₂! (another element that does this is oxygen, which you might already know as O₂!)
            <br>
            <br>
            The final group you need to know for now are the <span id="noblegases"><b>noble gases</b></span>! Noble gases are noble enough to stay on their own; they generally don't like to bond,
            or do pretty much anything with other elements, and much prefer to stay by themselves. This is because of their full valence shell and super small size, but we'll get into that later!
            These gases all reside at the very end of the table, on Group 18!
            <br>
            <br>
            Alright, that was a lot of information to get down. For now, just imagine metals on the left, non-metals on the right, and gases at the very end. Before we get any more deeper into the table, let's
            take a look at what each element will LOOK like when presented on the table.
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/periodictableoneelement.png" width=50% height=50% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <br>
            These numbers essentially offer a snapshot of information regarding the structure of an atom/element. The atomic number at the top will provide the number of protons, <em>and also</em> the number of electrons seperately.
            The number on the bottom will be the weight of the protons and neutrons COMBINED (both have a weight of 1), since they both exist in the heavy nucleus and are the main weight of the whole element.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, this oxygen atom will have 8 protons and 8 electrons in its base state, and since we know that 8 out of the 15.999 is from protons, that means there's around 8 neutrons left in the atom. Don't worry about any decimals you
            come across, just round to the nearest number and make that your neutron count. You cannot have a slice of a neutron, so don't leave that as your answer on any tests!
            <br>
            <br>
            Using this info, we can draw what the atom looks like, figure out its valence shells and what it wants to bond with, and later figure out some other cool stuff such as atomic size and ionization with just these numbers!
