        <p class="paragraph">
            The periodic table, first created in its moden state sometime in 1869 by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, gave scientists and chemists alike
            the opportunity to find relations and properties of elements based on where they were placed. The concept is simple, every element is organized
            into a <span id="period"><b>period</b></span> and a <span id="row"><b>row</b></span> that corresponds to certain properties. The best thing about it is,
            most elements next to each other (nearby, same row or period) tend to share some similarities as well! Let's take a look:
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/periodictable.png" width=100% height=50%>
            <br>
            <br>
            It's a lot to look at, but let's just start from the left side. The first row, also known as Group 1, consists of your <span id="alkalimetals"><b>alkali metals</b></span>.
            Aside from hydrogen, which acts a bit different then the rest of the row, all of these elements act and react in a very similar fashion, aside from some
            differences in intensity and other physical characteristics. They'll bond similarily as well! (we'll go over that soon)
            <br>
            <br>
            The next row over is the <span id="alkalinemetals"><b>alkaline earth metal</b></span> group. Since the alkali metals are right next to Group 2, they share some similarities between them! First of all,
            they're both metals, which means they're generally shiny and like to conduct electricity.
