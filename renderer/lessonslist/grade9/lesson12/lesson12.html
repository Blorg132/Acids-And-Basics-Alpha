            Acids, bases, and the general concept of pH is super crucial within our daily lives, especially when it concerns biochemistry and how different substances interact with each other.
            I'm sure that even if you haven't taken chemistry in school, you've likely heard of the more well-known acids, and how they like to burn through things and dissolve villains in spy movies. Let's first go over what being an acid and a base actually <em>means</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Acids are simply substances recognized to have a low pH and have certain acidic properties. They often contain hydrogen in their composition, as the acids commonly release hydrogen ions (H+)
            <br>
            <br>
            The main 5 reaction types are <span id="Synthesis"><b>Synthesis</b></span>, <span id="Decomposition"><b>Decomposition</b></span>, <span id="Single Replacement"><b>Single Replacement</b></span>, <span id="Double Replacement"><b>Double Replacement</b></span>, and <span id="Combustion"><b>Combustion</b></span> which is slightly different from the rest.
