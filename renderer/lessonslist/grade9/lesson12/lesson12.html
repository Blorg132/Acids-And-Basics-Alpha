            Acids, bases, and the general concept of pH is super crucial within our daily lives, especially when it concerns biochemistry and how different substances interact with each other.
            I'm sure that even if you haven't taken chemistry in school, you've likely heard of the acidic and corrosive substances, and how they like to burn through things and dissolve villains in spy movies. Let's first go over what being an acid and a base actually <em>means</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Acids are simply substances recognized to have a low pH and have certain acidic properties. They often contain hydrogen in their composition, as acids commonly release hydrogen ions (H+) in solution.
            Bases on the other hand, usually have high pH values and carry different <em>basic</em> ("basic" as in chemical bases, not "simply" or "rudimentary") properties. Let's take a look at the pH scale so you can get
            a better idea of how these two parallel each other.
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            The general pH scale ranges from 0-14, with 7 being the middle value. Anything with a pH of 7 is considered to be "neutral", such as water. In general, most of the stuff we eat/drink will reside around the neutral
            mark. If we ingest something far away from a pH of 7, it has a chance to really upset our stomachs or cause damage to our bodies. For example, drinking a liter of concentrated lemon juice is VERY different than
            drinking a liter of water. While you might just feel "full" from the water, the lemon juice will likely make your stomach churn and your throat/insides will feel rough and burnt. The same thing goes for the other end.
            All parents advise against drinking bleach/soap for similar reasons. It'll really upset your stomach, cause chemical burns, and can even lead to death. Acids and bases can be really dangerous, but its impossible to live without them.
            Our own digestive system relies on strong acid within our body to break down food, and we all need bases to clean our house and hands.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you haven't noticed already, acids and bases are essentially opposites in terms of pH. As I said before, acids usually give off hydrogen ions, [H+]. Bases usually give off hydroxide ions, also known as [OH-]. The more a substance leans towards either 0 or 14,
            the more they release their respective ions (H+ or OH-). When these hydroxide and hydrogen ions actually meet each other in mixtures, like if we mix battery acid and bleach, they combine to form the compound H₂O, neutral water! This means that an acid combined with a base <em>neutralizes</em>, getting closer and closer to a pH of 7 as their ions interact.
            Anything else part of the acid and base (aside from the hydroxide and hydrogen) combine to form a <span id="salt"><b>salt</b></span>. Let's look at where this pops up in daily life.
            <br>
            <br>
            Remember that liter of lemon juice? Let's say you drank a cup of it, and now your stomach acid is going all over the place. It's way too acidic in there, and you're starting to feel that uncomfortable burning sensation.
            But hey! You have a spare Alka-Seltzer tablet in your pocket. So, you put it into water, let it dissolve, and drink the liquid. After a while, everything starts to feel a little better in your stomach.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="../../../images/lesson12/ea14116216ca4faf8ffd1215f14c2253.jpg" width=70% height=70% style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <br>

            So, what actually happened here? Well, Alka-Seltzers contain the base sodium bicarbonate (Na₂HCO₃), also known as baking soda. When this base hits your acidic stomach, it neutralizes it as hydroxide hits hydrogen ions inside.
            Soon, the pH of your stomach acid will increase to alleviate your discomfort, and then later return to its regular pH of around 1. But let's say you didn't have an Alka-Seltzer. If you drank a lot of water, things would also
            settle down. When we add water (a neutral substance) to either an acid or a base, it will slowly raise/lower its pH towards 7 as well. It's not exactly "neutralization", as the H+ or OH- still exists inside. However, its
            <span id="concentration"><b>concentration</b></span> is much lower because of your addition of water. Imagine 10 angry people in a room. If you add 100 calm people to that room, the angry people are still just as angry.
            But the room as a whole now is <em>generally</em> more calm, because the angry people are less noticeable and have less of an effect.
