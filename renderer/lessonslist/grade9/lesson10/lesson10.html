        <p class="paragraph">

            Since you already know that every piece of matter is already made up of <em>particles</em>, we can dive a bit deeper into this
            concept regarding states of matter.
            <br>
            <br>
            Matter is made up of a bunch of particles bouncing around. But how many particles bounce around, and how fast they bounce around, is dependent
            on the actual state of matter. Solids, such as ice and wood, have the slowest moving particles. They generally don't move past each other
            and stay in a rigid structure, keeping their form no matter where they are. 
            Liquids are in the middle of the spectrum. They have faster moving particles that are actually able to move and flow past each other. This
            is one of the reasons that liquids "flow" in a container and fill up volume.
            Gases are at the very fast end of the spectrum. Their particles are zipping around, and there's hardly any proper form/connection between these
            particles aside from them all being part of the same piece of matter. Take a look at the image below to understand the differences between these three.
            <br>

            As you already know from the basics of the KMT, an increase of temperature on a state of matter will increase the speed of particles, which increases <span id="kineticenergy"><b>kinetic energy</b></span>!
            This means that as we head towards gas, the kinetic energy of our matter increases, and as we head the reverse way, it'll go down.
            Don't worry about the increasing <span id="imf"><b>IMF</b></span> here for now... we'll discuss that in Avogadro's Arena! >:)

            <br>
            <br>
            We know that a change in state of matter is a physical change that can be attained by increasing/decreasing temperature. Water will turn solid
            once the temperature drops (ice), and it'll turn into gas once you boil it (steam). The higher temperature makes faster particles, changing states
            of matter and increasing the kinetic energy. But as you can tell, gases act a little bit differently than the other states. Let's take a look at that now!

            <br>
            <br>
            If we want to examine a gas, we find that it has two major variables to look at: <em>pressure</em> and <em>volume</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pressure is essentially how hard a gas pushes AGAINST its container by colliding with it in order to get out. If I have 300g of gas in a beaker, it will have a higher
            pressure than 200g in the <em>same</em> beaker. This is because there are more particles with more collisions pushing against the container to try and get out!
            Volume is the container space that you put the gas inside. Are you housing the gas in a room, in a empty milk container, or a small soda can?
            <br>
            <br>
            These two are actually linked with each other as well! If I have 200g of gas, and shrink the container from a milk jug to a water bottle, the
            pressure of the gas will go up! This is because there's less space inside meaning more collisions with the outside walls. If I increase the pressure,
            the volume that it will take will decrease as well. Think about it as if I squished a spring together; if I want that spring to push back more, it needs
            to first take up a smaller space/be more squished.
            <br>
            <br>

            If you don't understand this concept for now, that's alright. We'll clarify it more when we actually solve for pressures and volumes of a gas. But for now,
            just keep in mind that every gas will have a pressure and volume, and that they change depending on each other.
